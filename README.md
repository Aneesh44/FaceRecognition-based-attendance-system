create a google spreadsheet enable drive and sheets api for it 
and  get the credential files for it ( follow this video if you don't know how https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnPlKLEGR7E&t=391s&ab_channel=TechWithTim)
add the credentials file into the same directory 
change the credentials file name in the code (my file name is "creds")
change the spreadsheet file name in the code (my file name is"attendance") 
change the sender email ID. 
and you are good to go
